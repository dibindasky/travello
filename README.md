 Flutter Travel Guide App.
    This is my first Flutter project, a travel guide app for Kerala. The app uses Firebase and SQLite for the database. It provides a list of destinations in Kerala,  with the ability to sort and filter the list. It also includes a trip planner feature that allows users to create and manage their own trip plans.

 Features
   * List of all destinations in Kerala, with the ability to sort and filter the list
   * Detailed view for each destination, with information such as photos, description, and location
   * Trip planner feature that allows users to create and manage their own trip plans
   * Easy sorting and searching features
